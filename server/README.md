## Folder Structure

### `index.js`
The main entry point of the application. It initializes the Express server and sets up middleware such as routing, error handling, and CORS.

### `routes/`
Contains all the route definitions for your application. Each file in this directory corresponds to a different resource or functionality, such as user routes, authentication routes, etc. The routes import functions from the `services/` directory and map them to HTTP requests.

### `services/`
Holds the business logic and helper functions. The services interact with the models and are imported into route files to process the incoming requests and return appropriate responses. This layer ensures that the routes remain clean and focused solely on handling HTTP requests.

### `models/`
Contains abstraction layers and models for the application's data. This could be database models, external API wrappers, or other necessary abstractions for the app's operations. The models interact directly with the data layer, ensuring smooth data handling and retrieval.
